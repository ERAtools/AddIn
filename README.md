## ERAtools ArcMap Add-In

The ERAtools ArcMap Add-In was developed by URS Corp (now AECOM) under contract with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, based on code originally developed by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The Florida Department of Health funded the development of several new features of ERAtools and the ERAtools Administrator application, including a modification of the weighted average analysis and the addition of the Direction and Distance analysis, and options to the ERAtools interface to suppress warning messages. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service funded a modification to this application to change how “saved” shapes are stored. These are now stored in the WGS 1984 geographic coordinate system, allowing for analysis features outside of the State of Florida to be saved. (Versions 2.7 and earlier stored data in the Florida Albers projection.)

This release of ERAtools has been written for ArcMap 10.2, it has not been tested on newer versions of ArcMap. The Microsoft .Net framework version 2.0 is required for this extension to run.
